# Pizza Website

Hartie's Pizza is a first attempt to create a dummy website mainly from HTML and CSS. 
The pages are made up of forms, animations, navigation links, and mostly all the basics of HTML and CSS.
It isn't pretty and I'm sure there are better ways of using the code or shortcuts that I haven't learnt about just yet. 
They are a couple kinks I couldnt straighten out and i will put those in Issues.
